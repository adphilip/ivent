## IVENT Meet-Up Event App

> Event App for locals

### Based on polymer starter kit And Firebase hosting:

* [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/), [Paper](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=paper-elements), [Iron](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=iron-elements) and [Neon](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=neon-elements) elements
* [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) hosting
* Routing with [Page.js](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/)
* Unit testing with [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
* Optional offline setup through [Platinum](https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse?package=platinum-elements) Service Worker elements
* End-to-end Build Tooling (including [Vulcanize](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize))
* [Recipes](/docs/README.md/) for ES2015 support, Polymer performance, using Chrome Dev Editor, Deploying to GitHub Pages, Deploying to Firebase, Mobile Chrome Apps and lint tools.

## Getting Started

To take advantage of IVENT you need to:

1. Get a copy of the code.
2. Install the dependencies if you don't already have them.
3. Modify the application to your liking.
4. Deploy your production code.


### Install dependencies

#### Quick-start (for experienced users)

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your Polymer Starter Kit download:

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The IVENT requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).
- The starter kit gulp build process uses platform specific tools which is handled by node-gyp which is included in node.js. See https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/README.md for additional platform specific dependencies.

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above 0.12.x.

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower
```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
cd polymer-starter-kit && npm install && bower install
```

This installs the element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools the starter kit requires to build and serve apps.

### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

To run tests Java 7 or higher is required. To update Java go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and download ***JDK*** and install it.

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```
